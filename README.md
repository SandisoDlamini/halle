halle is a website for discovering and exploring the deep history and culture of Eswatini and help users and visitors of the site better plan their trips and travels there. It's built using Rust's Axum web framework for the backend and html/tailwind css for the frontend with htmx for intergration between the two. Will most likely intergrate Alpine.js to improve the frontend experience in the future. We welcome you to our wonderful country.
